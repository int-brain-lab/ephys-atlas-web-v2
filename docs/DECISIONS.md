# Decision log

## D001 — Separate v2

Build v2 in this repository independently of the legacy `int-brain-lab/ephys-atlas-web`. Keep v1 deployable as fallback through launch.

## D002 — Frontend stack

Use TypeScript + Vite with plain web-platform UI code. Do not use React or another frontend framework by default.

## D003 — Launch dataset scope

Launch-critical: `ephys_atlas_channels`, `ephys_atlas_clusters`, `ephys_atlas_volumes`, `brainwide_map`, and `local`.

AGEA, MERFISH, and large point datasets can follow after launch.

## D004 — Statistics

Launch supports descriptive/basic statistics and visual comparison only. No inferential statistical tests are required. The design should permit more advanced tests later.

## D005 — Releases

Published dataset releases are immutable. Mutable aliases such as `latest` may point to an immutable release. The paper-facing default should resolve to an immutable publication snapshot.

## D006 — Legacy compatibility

Backward compatibility with old custom buckets/URLs is low priority because the existing site has had very limited use. Prefer a clean v2 contract. Keep v1 online temporarily rather than compromising v2 architecture.

## D007 — SVG slices

Reuse existing curated SVG assets where practical. Their manually tuned alignment is acceptable for display; document calibration explicitly and avoid treating it as canonical geometry.

## D008 — 3D

3D technology is undecided and explicitly renderer-agnostic. Datoviz is one candidate, not a requirement. 3D is lower priority than the regional/volume viewer and data pipeline.

## D009 — Publishing auth

Retain a capability-based publishing model for launch rather than introducing full user accounts/OAuth. Existing v1 auth should be studied and modernized rather than copied blindly.
